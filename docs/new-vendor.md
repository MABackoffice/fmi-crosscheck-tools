# New Vendors

If you are a vendor who wants information about their tools displayed
on the [FMI homepage](https://fmi-standard.org), then the first step is
to send an email to the [FMI Project
Leader](mailto:projectleader@fmi-standard.org) by filling out the following
template:

```
FMI Project Leader,

  My company would like to be included in the list of FMI supporting vendors.
I am including the following information in order to initiate that process:

Vendor Name:
Vendor ID:
GitHub User Names:
```

Note that the `Vendor Name` is how your company or organization's name will
appear on the FMI web site. The `Vendor ID` should be a unique identifier
(only letters and numbers, no spaces or special characters) that isn't already
claimed by another vendor (see here for [a list of claimed vendor
ids](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-crosscheck-tools/blob/master/build-server/vendors.json)).

Since you will be responsible for managing the contents of your repository,
you must appoint one or more people to update your FMI compliance information.
In order to start the process, we must have the GitHub user name for at least
one of those people.
